# MultiModuleAndroidApp
A multi-module Android application with resources and UI in two secondary modules

This project builds correctly and the application runs.

However, Android Studio seems to not be able to generate the R class.

This project was created by starting from the "Navigation Drawer Activity" template, and then moving most of the resources to a module and the whole UI to another module.

This is now an assigned Android Studio issue with priprity P3: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/151765079
